## About Me

I first touched code when I was 15 years old (it was only HTML... shh!). This sparked a fire of curiosity in me, that kept me coming back. "Could I do this?", I always asked myself.

I ended up pursuing nursing and worked in a variety of health care facilities all over the US. Still, my passion for coding remained. I spent my weekends messing around learning CSS, and later on, JavaScript. Flash forward to 2020, and I decided to pursue my dream to become a software developer full-time.
After a few months of independent study, I joined Bloc's Full Stack Flex Bootcamp (now currently owned by Thinkful). This Bootcamp gave me the direction and mentorship I needed to stay on track while challenging me to push myself in ways I haven't before.

I am passionate about adventure, pushing my comfort zone, and pursuing creative outlets. When I'm not coding, I'm usually creating music, learning more about photography, doing yoga, or exploring the world.
