## About Me

I first touched code when I was 15 years old (it was only HTML... shh!). This sparked a fire of curiosity in me, that kept me coming back. "Could I do this?", I always asked myself.

Well rounded experience transitioning from a successful humanities profession in nursing to software engineering. Working in healthcare for half of a decade taught me the importance of paying attention to detail and helped to develop an agile mentality of solutioning in a scalable and repeatable manner. After deciding to pursue my software engineering career full-time, I have taken my “lessons-learned” from my previous experience and applied my critical thinking prowess into positively impacting what I saw firsthand as an area needing improvement in an important industry. As I’ve continued expanding my expertise while leveraging my previous experience, I have found my current passion aligning with software engineering holistically and am dedicating myself to growing in that expertise specifically.
